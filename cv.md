### ___About me___

I have basic layout skills, there is the concept of front-end development. <br>
At the moment I have a main job, but I would like to do something else. In my spare time, <br>
I spend my free time studying front-end development. I want to learn something new and use these skills in the future.<br>
Of course, I would like to study English in parallel, since in the future knowledge of the language will be very useful to me.<br>
But at the moment I speak three languages, Uzbek Russian and Kazakh.<br>

This course was recommended to me. After completing this course, I will develop in a new direction.<br>

### ___Code Example___

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct.<br>
However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.<br>

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.<br>

```
function maskify(cc) {
  let result = cc.split('')
  for(let i = 0; i<result.length;i++){
    if(i < result.length - 4){
      result[i] = '#';
    }
  }

  return result.join('')
}
```

## ___English___
I didn't study English. I don't have practice. But there is a partial understanding of the words.
